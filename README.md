As of 2018, data collection covers all 349 communes in the country (except Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, which are special status communes).

Under SUPERMUN, **sixteen (16) performance indicators** were developed and fall into two categories: seven (7) indicators on the **institutional capacity** of municipal governments, and nine (09) indicators on **public service delivery**. Institutional capacity indicators relate to _municipality staff, regular municipal council sessions and consultation forums, tax revenue collected and procurement plan execution_. In the category of public service delivery, the indicators relate to _education, health, water and sanitation, and civil registration_.
